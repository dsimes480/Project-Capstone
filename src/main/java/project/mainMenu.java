            "NOTE 1 In those cases where a well-recognized test method specifies limits to the values of the major sources " +
            "of measurement uncertainty and specifies the form of presentation of the calculated results, the laboratory is " +
            "considered to have satisfied 7.6.3 by following the test method and reporting instructions.\n\n" +
            "NOTE 2 For a particular method where the measurement uncertainty of the results has been established and " +
